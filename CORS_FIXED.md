# âœ… CORS Issue Fixed!

## ðŸ”§ **Problem Identified and Resolved:**

### **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Issue**
- **Problem**: Vercel frontend was blocked from accessing Render backend
- **Error**: "Access to fetch at 'https://treasury-vault-timer-backend.onrender.com/api/dashboard' from origin 'https://frontend-aiuwqs319-booradleybtcs-projects.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy"
- **Root Cause**: Your specific Vercel URL was not in the CORS allowlist
- **Solution**: Added `https://frontend-aiuwqs319-booradleybtcs-projects.vercel.app` to both:
  - Express CORS middleware
  - Socket.IO CORS configuration
- **Status**: âœ… **FIXED**
